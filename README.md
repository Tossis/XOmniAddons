Xposed Module to add missing features to OmniRom 4.4

I use Omnirom on the Galaxy Note N7000 and although OmniRom is getting better each day, I still miss some features
Lucky - with the use of Xposed - we can add some of those features to the rom, until they are supported natively (if ever)
So below is a list of features I plan to add, as long as they are not supported natively. Once supported they will be removed from the module, so they will
not conflict with the native implementation.

Feel free to use the code in you own project, but please give proper credit for the code you use.

Here are my Credits for code/help I got to do this little project of mine.

- XDA - For Ideas and Help on my Android Devices
- rovo89 - For Xposed Framework and some Code from Xposed Modules
- OmniRom Team - For a great Rom on the Galaxy Note
- C3C076 - For GravityBox Xposed module and some Code

If someone is missing, please let me know
